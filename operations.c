Addition: var1 + var2 - this expression will display the sum of the two supplied
vectors. The vectors must exist or an error message should be
displayed.

/*
Subtraction: var1 - var2 - this expression will display the difference of the two
supplied vectors. The vectors must exist or an error message should be
displayed. 
*/

/*
Scalar Multiplication: var1 * num or num * var1 - this expression will display the
vector scalar multiplied by num which may be any valid value afforded by floating
point numbers (double). The vector must exist or an error message should be
displayed.
*/


/*
Operation plus assignment: result = var1 + var2 - performs the operation
indicated (addition, subtraction, or scalar multiplication) and assigns the result to
indicated result vector. If the result vector does not exist it will be created and if
there is no room a message will be displayed. If the result vector exists, it will be
replaced with the new values. In any case, the result of the operation should also
be displayed.
